					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p><b>WARSIM</b> is a multiplayer game mode for ArmA 3. Its core features are player persistence, dynamic missions and territory control. 
					There are three factions made up of players - NATO, CSAT and the AAF. Each faction fights to control the most territory with added AI missions/attacks throughout to keep you on your toes. 
					Players can setup observation posts and forward operating bases that generate territory, allowing that faction to deploy more assets further afield.
					Go on deployment with your friends, get promoted through the ranks, train to be specialist roles and lots more! 
					The rebels have gained territory across Altis.</p>
					<ol type="I">
							<li>Persistence - We save your position, loadout, role, rank, direction, deployments, everything.</li>
							<li>Deployments - Go on deployment and spend your time at a forward operating base. You can't return to HQ until the job's done.</li>
							<li>Rally Points - Create rally points for your group as you push into enemy territory. These are essentially mobile respawn positions only available to your group.</li>
							<li>Roles - As you progress through the ranks, new roles open up for you.</li>
						</ol>
					There are lots more features to be added such as special forces missions and advanced roles but right now the basic roles and basic deployments is what I am focusing on for the alpha.
					
					<br><br><b>WARSIM</b> is currently in development and will soon be open for public testing in its alpha stage.</p>

					<h2>CONTRIBUTING</h2>
					<p>You can help out with development by looking for bugs in the code base, or by contributing new features. 
					Please be aware that I have recently started from scratch so you may want to wait until I've implemented core features before contributing. 
					To contribute something to WARSIM, simply fork this repository and submit your pull requests. <b>Also please respect the file structure and config setup - I won't consider any additions that are messy!</b></p>
