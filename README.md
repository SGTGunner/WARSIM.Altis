**WARSIM** is a multiplayer game mode for <a href="http://arma3.com/">Arma 3</a>. Its core features are player persistence, dynamic missions and territory control. There are three factions made up of players - NATO, CSAT and the AAF. Each faction fights to control the most territory with added AI missions/attacks throughout to keep you on your toes. Players can setup observation posts and forward operating bases that generate territory, allowing that faction to deploy more assets further afield.

#### Contributing
You can help out with development by looking for bugs in the code base, or by contributing new features. *Please be aware that I have recently started from scratch so you may want to wait until I've implemented core features before contributing.* To contribute something to WARSIM, simply fork this repository and submit your pull requests. **Also please respect the file structure and config setup - I won't consider any additions that are messy!**
